  see textfire.co<br>
  textfire is a tool to create dialog based games.<br>
<br>
  a dialog contains in minimum one text.<br>
  a click or timer event will show the next dialog.<br> 
<br>
  advanced dialogs can have inputs to set varables like the user name or validated input like a keyword. a validated input has one right answer.<br>
<br>
  dialogs also can be a user choice, a selection. this is a colection of two or more texts with different dialogs for each to follow, if you want to.<br>
<br>  
  in a classic dialog two or more persons interact. so do not forget to
  setup the personage. if you use input dialogs, the user can customize all persons' names.<br>
  you can customize a person by choosing a color for each person.
  the position and the size are also optional.<br>
<br>
  with every dialog the background image can be change. so you can do with the music loop. Be carefull, do not do this to often. a text will use the image as a icon. the audio will be used as an event sound - click , time or keyinput.
